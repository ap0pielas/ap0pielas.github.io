								<h3>Custom Engagement Ring</h3>

								<p> While looking for engagement rings I couldn't find anything that felt personal enough. I stumbled on a service provided by a jeweller in Toronto that could 3D print wax jewelry casting and then cast with personal metals. 
								I figured with my CAD experience I could try to make my own design, which I knew my partner would greatly appreciate. So I decided on the gem sizes, researched jewely design guides, and set out to create a design.
								The inspiration of the design was two A's coming together since both of our names start with A. It also illicits a fish shape which alludes to our year living in St. John's which was a particularly formative time in our relationship.
								I decided to use a central 2.5 karat marquise cut center moissanite gem flanked by two round cut black moissainite gems. I asked her grandmother for some sterling silver which came from a teaspoon that was part of a wedding gift she received. 
								Before committing I had a resin 3D print made to make sure it looked good physically and to do a test fit with the gems.</p>

								<p>Finally, I took all of this to the jeweller and had them cast and put together the ring. </p>

								<h3>Lego Millenium Falcon</h3>
									<p>Inspired by a post on reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign, I purchased a small lego set (75295) of an iconic Star Wars ship and am modelling each piece in order to practice my modelling skills in Fusion 360 (and for fun). Once modelling is complete, appropriate materials will be applied to components for a photorealistic render.</p>

									<h2>More About Me</h2>
									<p>Of course I do more than just work! Here are some ways that I like to spend my free time! 
								</header>
								<h3>Ballroom &amp; Latin Dance</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ballroom_dance.JPG" alt="ballroom_dance" width="200"/></span>My partner and I have been dancing since 2017 when we were first swept up in the acivity. What started as a fun activity just for the summer became a passion for the two of us. We love that we get to have a date-night activity all the time that exercises not just our bodies but also our minds. We currently have Rumba, Cha Cha, Mambo, East Coast Swing, West Coast Swing, Foxtrot, Waltz, Viennese Waltz, and Tango as part of our repertoire! We have dreams of doing amateur dance competitions internationally! </p>

								<h3>Reading</h3>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://onlinereadfreenovel.com/i2/brian-mcclellan/powder_mage_trilogy_01_-_promise_of_blood.jpg" alt="" width="200"/></span>When I was a kid, I couldn't put my books down. As I grew older I started spending more time with friends, doing part time work, and doing other hobbies and reading started to fall to the wayside. As an adult I was greatly influenced to get back into reading by my partner who is an avid reader. Now I read every night, and if a book is incredible, I find myself reading throughout the day when I have some time. I will read anything that catched my interest, from fantasy epics like the <i>Stormlight Archive</i> from Brandon Sanderson to historical non-fiction like <i>Enemy of All Mankind</i> by Steven Johnson. <br> My current read is <i>Promise of Blood</i> by Brian McClellan while my Audiobook at the moment is <i>Chip Wars</i> by Chris Miller </p>

								<h3>Travel</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AP1GczNoDbb0LRQOGgwFWPxwjyT7_BMqwT-dx28rhZs2MYj9-qeiVtb9KxwQvU8K4LDyHNowXAS5gMt8_X5NO7N4R9Li3BpPdIUeqEER1QfY52FDlckiX6uo4VFgFjLvBKzA8o-M69_8dqBu3go1waoeHqZsCw=w1716-h1287-s-no?authuser=1" width="200"/></span>I love to travel! I think there is so much to see and experience in this vast world and I want to spend my life enjoying as much of it as I can! My goal is to do a major trip at least once per year. This year I travelled back to Newfoundland for my honeymoon. The trip was incredible and it was so great to revisit some places that I had been to when I lived there. A highlight of that trip was when we encountered some whales while sea kayaking. I have a long list of trips I would love to take at some point in my life including riding on horseback in the Mongolian steppe, taking a train through the Alps from Switzerland to Italy, and visiting Africa to see safari wildlife. <br> Here is a picture of me sitting in the Traditional Japanese Village (Saiko Iyashi-no-Sato Nenba) with Mount Fuji in the background. </p>
